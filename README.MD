## 🧠 Professional Profile

Full-Stack Developer with hands-on experience in designing, developing and deploying production-level applications.

I specialize in building scalable frontend architectures with React & Next.js, while also engineering robust backend systems using Node.js and modern databases.

Beyond development, I integrate Technical SEO, performance optimization and digital growth strategy directly into product architecture.

💡 I don’t just write code — I build systems that scale technically and commercially.
